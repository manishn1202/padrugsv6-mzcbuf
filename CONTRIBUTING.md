## Introduction

Welcome to the Prior Authorization Management System contribution guidelines. This document outlines our security-first, HIPAA-compliant development process. Due to the sensitive nature of healthcare data, all contributors must adhere to strict security protocols and compliance requirements.

### Key Requirements
- HIPAA compliance certification
- Signed contributor agreement
- Security-first development practices
- PHI (Protected Health Information) handling training
- Comprehensive security review process

## Development Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- Node.js 18+
- Docker 24.0+
- AWS CLI v2
- Poetry 1.7.0
- Security tools suite:
  - SonarQube Scanner
  - OWASP Dependency Check
  - Snyk CLI
  - GitGuardian
- HIPAA compliance training certification

### Local Environment Setup
1. Clone the repository using SSH:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:organization/prior-auth-system.git
   ```

2. Configure git security settings:
   ```bash
   git config --global commit.gpgsign true
   git config --global user.signingkey YOUR_GPG_KEY
   ```

3. Install dependencies with security checks:
   ```bash
   poetry install --with dev
   poetry run pre-commit install
   ```

4. Configure secure environment variables:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   # Edit .env.local with your secure credentials
   ```

## Development Workflow

### Branching Strategy
- `main` - Production releases (protected, requires security approval)
- `develop` - Integration branch (protected, requires HIPAA compliance check)
- `feature/*` - New features (requires security review)
- `bugfix/*` - Bug fixes (requires vulnerability assessment)
- `security/*` - Security updates (highest priority)

### Commit Guidelines
1. All commits MUST be GPG signed
2. Follow conventional commits with security context:
   ```
   type(scope): description [SEC-IMPACT: LOW|MED|HIGH]
   ```
3. Never include PHI or sensitive data in commits
4. Reference security requirements when applicable

### Branch Naming Convention

Example: feature/PA-123/secure-document-upload
```

## Code Standards

### Security-First Practices
- Input validation on all user data
- Parameterized queries only
- Encryption for data in transit and at rest
- Secure logging (no PHI in logs)
- Memory sanitization for sensitive data

### HIPAA Compliance Requirements
- PHI encryption at rest and in transit
- Audit logging for all PHI access
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Secure session management
- Automatic inactivity timeout

### Code Quality
- 90% test coverage minimum
- SonarQube quality gate passing
- No critical or high vulnerabilities
- OWASP Top 10 compliance
- Regular dependency updates

## Security Requirements

### Authentication & Authorization
- Multi-factor authentication required
- JWT with appropriate expiration
- Role-based access control
- Session management
- Audit logging

### Data Protection
- AES-256 encryption for PHI
- TLS 1.3 for data in transit
- Secure key management
- Data minimization
- Secure data deletion

### Vulnerability Management
- Weekly dependency scanning
- Monthly penetration testing
- Quarterly security assessments
- Immediate security patch deployment
- Vulnerability disclosure process

## Testing Requirements

### Security Testing
- SAST (Static Application Security Testing)
- DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing)
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Penetration testing
- Security regression testing

### Compliance Testing
- HIPAA compliance validation
- PHI handling verification
- Access control testing
- Audit log validation
- Encryption verification

### Performance Testing
- Load testing with security controls
- Stress testing of security measures
- Failover testing
- Backup/restore validation
- Rate limiting verification

## Pull Request Process

1. Create PR using the security-focused template
2. Complete security impact assessment
3. Pass automated security checks:
   - SAST scan
   - HIPAA compliance check
   - Dependency scan
   - Test coverage
   - Code quality metrics

4. Required approvals:
   - Security team review
   - HIPAA compliance review
   - Technical review
   - Product security review

5. Merge requirements:
   - All checks passing
   - No security issues
   - HIPAA compliance verified
   - Signed commits
   - Up-to-date branch
