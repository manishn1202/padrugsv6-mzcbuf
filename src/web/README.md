# Prior Authorization Management System Frontend

A HIPAA-compliant web application for managing healthcare prior authorization workflows with secure PHI handling and FHIR integration.

## Security Notice

⚠️ This application handles Protected Health Information (PHI) and must be deployed in accordance with HIPAA Security Rule requirements. All developers must complete HIPAA security training before contributing.

## Project Overview

The Prior Authorization Management System frontend provides a secure interface for:
- Processing prior authorization requests with PHI protection
- Real-time integration with FHIR-compliant APIs
- Secure document management and transmission
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Comprehensive audit logging
- HIPAA-compliant workflows

### Technology Stack

- React 18.2+ - Enterprise UI framework
- TypeScript 5.0+ - Type-safe development
- Redux Toolkit 1.9+ - Secure state management
- MUI 5.14+ - HIPAA-compliant UI components
- React Query 4.0+ - Secure API integration
- React Hook Form 7.45+ - Validated form handling

## Security Requirements

### Authentication & Authorization
- OAuth 2.0 + OIDC compliance
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) required
- JWT with short expiration times
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Session timeout after 15 minutes of inactivity

### PHI Protection
- No PHI in logs or console
- Secure data transmission (TLS 1.3)
- Memory clearing after use
- No client-side storage of PHI
- Secure clipboard handling

### Audit Requirements
- All PHI access logged
- User actions tracked
- Failed authentication attempts recorded
- Session management events logged
- API call auditing

## Getting Started

### Security Prerequisites
1. Complete HIPAA security training
2. Install security-scanned Node.js 18+
3. Configure secure environment
4. Setup security scanning tools
5. Enable audit logging

### Secure Installation
```bash
# Install dependencies with security audit
npm ci --audit

# Verify security configurations
npm run security-check

# Setup pre-commit hooks
npm run setup-security-hooks
```

### Environment Configuration
Create a `.env.local` file with security settings:
```
# Security Configuration
VITE_API_URL=https://api.pamanagement.com
VITE_AUTH_DOMAIN=auth.pamanagement.com
VITE_IDLE_TIMEOUT=900000
VITE_SECURE_HEADERS=true
VITE_AUDIT_ENABLED=true
```

## Development Guidelines

### Security Best Practices
1. No PHI in component state
2. Secure API call patterns
3. Input sanitization
4. XSS prevention
5. CSRF protection
6. Secure error handling

### Development Workflow
```bash
# Start secure development server
npm run dev:secure

# Run security linting
npm run lint:security

# Run security tests
npm run test:security
```

### Testing Requirements
- Security unit tests required
- HIPAA compliance tests
- Penetration testing
- Security scanning
- Access control testing

## Deployment Procedures

### Pre-deployment Checklist
1. Security scan completion
