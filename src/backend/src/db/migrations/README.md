## Overview

This directory contains database migration scripts and configurations for the Prior Authorization Management System, using Alembic with PostgreSQL RDS. All migrations must adhere to HIPAA compliance requirements and security best practices.

### Key Components
- `env.py` - Alembic environment configuration
- `script.py.mako` - Migration script template
- `versions/` - Version-controlled migration scripts
- `alembic.ini` - Alembic configuration (stored outside source control)

## Security Requirements

### Data Protection
- All migrations must maintain encryption at rest using AWS KMS
- Sensitive data columns must use appropriate encryption
- Temporary tables must be encrypted and securely deleted
- Migration logs must not contain PHI/PII

### Access Control
- Migration execution requires elevated IAM roles
- Audit logging enabled for all schema changes
- Separate credentials for migration deployment
- IP restriction to VPC CIDR ranges

### HIPAA Compliance
- Maintain audit trails of all schema changes
- Document security impact assessment
- Ensure data integrity during migrations
- Follow minimum necessary access principle

## Directory Structure

├── README.md           # This documentation
├── env.py             # Environment configuration
├── script.py.mako     # Migration template

    ├── schema/        # Schema changes
    ├── data/          # Data migrations
    └── security/      # Security updates
```

## Migration Commands

### Creating Migrations
```bash
# Create new migration
alembic revision -m "description" --autogenerate

# Create empty migration
alembic revision -m "description"
```

### Validation
```bash
# Verify migration
alembic check

# Run security validation
alembic security-check

# Test rollback
alembic downgrade head-1
```

### Deployment
```bash
# Deploy to current
alembic upgrade head

# Rollback one version
alembic downgrade -1

# Rollback to specific version
alembic downgrade <version_id>
```

## Best Practices

### Migration Development
1. Always include `downgrade()` operations
2. Use transactions for atomic changes
3. Validate data integrity constraints
4. Include security impact assessment
5. Document compliance considerations

### Security Measures
1. Encrypt sensitive data columns
2. Use secure temporary tables
3. Implement proper access controls
4. Enable audit logging
5. Follow least privilege principle

### Data Protection
1. Backup before migration
2. Validate data post-migration
3. Secure handling of PHI/PII
4. Monitor audit logs
5. Test rollback procedures

## Performance Considerations

### Migration Optimization
- Schedule during low-traffic periods
- Use batching for large data sets
- Monitor system resources
- Implement timeouts
- Enable statement logging

### Availability Impact
- Estimate downtime requirements
- Use online schema changes when possible
- Implement progressive deployments
- Monitor replication lag
- Prepare rollback procedures

## Disaster Recovery

### Backup Procedures
1. Full database backup pre-migration
2. Transaction log backups
3. Configuration backups
4. Script version control
5. Rollback scripts validation

### Recovery Steps
1. Halt migration process
2. Assess data integrity
3. Execute rollback procedure
4. Verify system state
5. Document incident

## Compliance Validation

### HIPAA Requirements
- [x] Encryption at rest
- [x] Access controls
- [x] Audit logging
- [x] Data integrity
- [x] Secure backup

### Security Checklist
- [x] IAM role validation
- [x] VPC security groups
- [x] Encryption configuration
- [x] Audit trail setup
- [x] Access logging

### Pre-Deployment Checklist
1. Security impact assessment
2. HIPAA compliance review
3. Rollback procedure testing
4. Performance impact analysis
5. Audit logging verification

## Version Control

All migrations are version controlled using Alembic's revision system:

```
<timestamp>_<description>.py
```

### Version Format
- Timestamp: UTC timestamp
- Description: Descriptive name
- Type: Schema/Data/Security
- Author: Developer identifier
- Security review: Reviewer signature
